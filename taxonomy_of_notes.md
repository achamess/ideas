# 20180114181843 Taxonomy of Notes
tags:  #notetaking 

## Aims

- To remember (externalize remembering)
	- Remember other people's ideas
	- Remember your own ideas
	- A mixture of your and others people's ideas
- Sense-making (make new relationships between ideas in writing)
- To support production of new artifacts (writing)

## Types of notes:

- **Extracts**
	- What: Pieces of information from sources, either directly copied or as a paraphrase. 
	- Usage: For reference when creating new documents or artifacts. Also for long-term retention of useful information.
- **Collections and Lists**
	- References (not in prose) to other things
	- Usage:
		- Quick reference
		- Leads to more detailed information for usage for some specific purpose
		- To template some action
	- Types of Lists
		- Actionable items
		- Tasks
		- References (in bullet form)
- **Records and Logs**
	- For records
	- To derive insight
- **Templates**
	- To provide place holders to execute some tasks or action
	- To serve as reminders for gathering new information 
		- Examlpe: Medical note template
- **Summary/Overview**
	- Higher level documents that bring together lower level (more specific) information. Topical notes that serves to structure and explain discrete information. 
		- See [[20181007150300]] Structure Notes

Not all these go into the ZK. Template and Logs should stay out. Collections and Lists probably also don't need to be in the ZK, although I don't see why they couldn't. 


## Types of Notes Coming from Reference Sources

### General

I want to distinguish notes that are commenting on a source and those that are my original ideas. 

For the latter, I have the tag 

- #original_thought (my own thoughts that aren't a response to something)
- #idea (some new idea that emerges from things in the ZK)
	- For writing ideas or other things, I keep those in my nvALT. I'm still trying to make the boundary between the ZK and my nvALT 

### Papers

For individual zettels

- #result
- #background
- #approach 
- #analysis
- #fact 
- #method
- #argument 
- #hypothesis 
- #question 
- #conclusion 
- #critique 
- #figure
- #model
- #quote (direct quotes)
- #code (code example)
- #application 
- #action_point (especially for how-to and technical books. I want the action points) 


For each paper, I want to make one summary note that compiles all the individual zettels from a paper and also let's me write my thoughts. It would be nice to have a single summary. Also, in this way, I can add tags to the summary that let's me essentially tag papers without having to tag the original PDF. 

How do I identify the source? Well, each note should have a citekey. I think the citekey can be the identifier. 


### Books

Depending on the type of book, similar types can be used.     

- #result
- #fact 
- #method
- #argument 
- #hypothesis 
- #question 
- #conclusion 
- #critique 
- #figure
- #quote (direct quotes)
- #code (code example)
- #application 
- #model
- #table
- #action_point (especially for how-to and technical books. I want the action points) 

For #overview notes from books, types include:

- #overview
- #action_list
	- [[20181029193103]] Making Actionable Notes from Books - Pick The Brain 
- #outline (of the book)
- 

Similar to papers, I want one summary note for a book that essentially becomes an outline of the book, but comprised of modular zettels. 

For many books, what I really want are the action points. I want actionable knowledge. I care about the source and the evidence, but truly I just want to key points. 

Those key points will then go into a checklist-style cheat sheet that I can use to template my own actions. 

Thus, when I'm making notes, I don't need to copy everything verbatim. Perhaps it's useful to get the original zettels with their quote, but I want my summary. I need breadcrumbs to the details.

For example, if I'm taking code notes, I don't need to copy all the detail. I really need the entry points back to the detail. The details are all over many resources (PDFs, ebooks, websites,etc.). What I need is a meta-document that tells me where to get the details.
